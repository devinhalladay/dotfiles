# Predawn for Atom

### A dark UI and [syntax theme](https://github.com/jamiewilson/predawn-syntax) for [Atom](https://atom.io/packages/predawn-ui) and [Sublime Text](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Predawn)

# About

Predawn is a minimal interface theme and a syntax color scheme. It was originally just a slightly tweaked version (called Flatland-Alt) of the [Flatland](https://github.com/thinkpixellab/flatland) theme, which itself is a flat reworking of [Soda](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme/). I decided to keep going with cusomization and rework the entire theme. But I owe a lot to Flatland and Soda. Thanks guys!

Also, big thanks to [@johman10](http://github.com/johman10) and [@adammw](http://github.com/adammw) for helping get this ported over!

## Syntax Theme
I also highly reccomend installing the accompanying syntax theme, called [**predawn-syntax**](https://github.com/jamiewilson/predawn-syntax).

## I also threw in some dock icons just for fun:
