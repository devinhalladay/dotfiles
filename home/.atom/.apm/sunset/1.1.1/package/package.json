I did this because I didn't want people who installed sunset to have their themes blown away immediately.\n\n**Pick the UI and Syntax themes you want to use during Daytime and Nighttime.** You'll have to enter the theme names manually for now (until i build out a configuration view). After you set the daytime and nighttime themes sunset will begin working.\n\n**Then enter the times of Sunrise and Sunset in 24 hour format.** The defaults are daytime at 5am and nighttime at 6pm.\n\n**You're all set!**\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/codeimpossible/sunset/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/codeimpossible/sunset#readme","_id":"sunset@1.1.1","_shasum":"00cad8ac370e60995af671f5a01f2e772a1dc437","_resolved":"file:../d-116514-33309-bwcrdc/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116514-33309-bwcrdc/package.tgz"}
